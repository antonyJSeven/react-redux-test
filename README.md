# Decisions Making Process
This is designed to be the simplest, dependency free, version of the client we can come up with. The javascript community moves very quickly with lots opinions and we have our own. We are trying to keep things simple with pieces we understand and with as few black boxes as possible. In certain instances this might result in additional developer overhead but will give us more flexibility in the future.
